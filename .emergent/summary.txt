<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to build a cricket prediction and engagement platform, FREE11, to capture the 60 million displaced Real Money Gaming (RMG) users in India. The project is a 5-week sprint to have a soft launch ready for the IPL 2026 tournament.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Demand Rail Thesis):**
The initial rewards app concept has been pivoted to a Demand Rail Engine. This is a critical strategic shift.
*   **Core Loop:** Users convert their time and cricket prediction skill into coins (a non-financial token), which they redeem for real-world goods. This creates a Skill - Rail flywheel.
*   **Product Identity:** The platform is NOT a generic rewards app. Cricket prediction (Skill) is the primary feature. Ads and mini-games are demoted to Boosters or Accelerators.
*   **Brand-Funded Model:** The shop's products are structurally brand-funded. Every redemption must be attributable to a brand and campaign for ROAS tracking.
*   **PRORGA-Safe:** The coin economy is strictly controlled to be a non-financial instrument, compliant with Indian regulations. Coins are non-purchasable, non-withdrawable, and non-transferable. All gambling-related language is forbidden.
*   **User Experience:** The UI/UX must reinforce the core loop by showing users their progress to the next real-world good, their skill effectiveness (prediction accuracy), and their consumption unlocked (total value of goods redeemed).
*   **Progression & Ego:** The platform must include user levels, streaks, and badges to drive the Skill and Ego loops. Leaderboards must rank users by skill (accuracy), not by coins earned.
*   **Impulse Redemption:** The shop must include low-value items (e.g., ₹10-₹50 mobile recharges) to allow users to experience the Consumption Unlock early and frequently.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application has been successfully refactored to align with the Demand Rail thesis.
*   **Backend (FastAPI/MongoDB):** Includes user authentication (JWT), a cricket prediction API (mocked), user progression systems (levels, XP, badges), and a brand-funded product schema. A placeholder endpoint for a Brand ROAS dashboard is also implemented.
*   **Frontend (React/Tailwind/shadcn):** The UI has been completely redesigned.
    *   **Dashboard:** Highlights live cricket prediction as the primary Skill Earning activity and demotes other earning methods to a Boosters section. It prominently displays the user's rank, skill stats, and progress toward their next redeemable reward.
    *   **Shop:** Features an impulse rewards tier with low-cost items, Brand-funded tags on products, and nudges for users who are close to affording an item.
    *   **Profile:** Includes a My Wallet section with a clear PRORGA-safe disclaimer and tracks the total value of Consumption Unlocked.
    - **Navigation:** The main navigation has been reordered to , reinforcing the product's core user journey.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested one final tweak for Phase 1 before starting Phase 2: to add an FAQ item clarifying that FREE11 Coins are not money and are not withdrawable.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent for the API and frontend testing agent for the UI component.

    -   **Attempted fixes:** None.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Backend:** Create a new API endpoint (e.g., ) to serve FAQ content, possibly from a new  collection in MongoDB.
        2.  **Frontend:** Create a new  page component.
        3.  **Frontend:** Add a route for  in .
        4.  **Frontend:** Fetch and render the content from the  endpoint.
        5.  **Frontend:** Add a link to the new FAQ page in a suitable location (e.g., the page footer or profile settings).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a mandatory change requested by the user to enhance legal safety and user clarity.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
*   **P0: Phase 2: Clans & Leaderboards (Due: Mar 7, 2026):** Implement clans and leaderboards with strict guardrails:
    *   Leaderboards must rank by skill metrics (accuracy, streaks), not total coins.
    *   Clans are for belonging and challenges, with no coin pooling or P2P transfers.
*   **P0: Phase 3: Automation & Brand Tools (Due: Mar 14, 2026):** Build the automated voucher delivery system, a simple support chatbot, and the UI for the brand dashboard.
*   **P1: Phase 4: Beta Testing & Polish (Due: Mar 21, 2026):** Onboard beta users, fix bugs, and stabilize the application.
*   **P1: Phase 5: Launch Prep & Soft Launch (Due: Mar 26, 2026):** Final server preparations and go live.

**Future Tasks:**
*   **Full Public Launch & Fundraising (Post-IPL 2026):** Use traction from the soft launch for a public release and to raise a seed round.
*   **Monetization:** Integrate AdMob and premium subscription features.
*   **Live Integrations:** Implement live cricket data APIs and ONDC/Q-Comm for fulfillment.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Phase 1 Refactor (Demand Rail Alignment):** The entire application was successfully restructured from a generic rewards app into a Demand Rail Engine.
    -   **Backend:** Updated DB schemas () for brand-funded products and user progression. Added new APIs for progression and a placeholder Brand ROAS dashboard (). Seeded new impulse rewards ().
    -   **Frontend:** Created a new  hero-ing cricket predictions. Re-labeled  to . Overhauled  with impulse rewards and brand-funded tags. Created a  with a wallet disclaimer. Updated  to reflect the new user journey.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   **Issue:** Agent has previously shown confusion with dates (day, month, year).
*   **Recurrence count:** High (from initial handoff).
*   **Status:** RESOLVED. The agent successfully followed the sprint timeline in this session, but this remains a historical risk to be aware of.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB (with Beanie ODM)
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
*   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   **Core Product Concept:** Demand Rail Engine

**key DB schema**
*   ****: 
*   ****: 
*   ****: 
*   **To be added**: , , 

**All files of reference**
*   ****: The main server file containing most of the application logic.
*   ****: Contains all Pydantic/Beanie models for the database schema.
*   ****: The new homepage, central to the Demand Rail thesis.
*   ****: The redesigned shop with impulse rewards.
*   ****: Contains the user's wallet and progression stats.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The  file is monolithic and contains logic for auth, users, products, cricket, and progression. It should be broken down into dedicated router files (e.g., , , ) for better maintainability as the application grows.

**key api endpoints**
*   **Existing:** , , , , ,  (placeholder)
*   **To be added:** , , 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **The Thesis is King:** Your primary directive is to build features that align with the Demand Rail Engine thesis. Every decision should reinforce the  loop. Do not revert to generic rewards app patterns.
*   **User is Strategic:** The user provides high-level strategic direction. Pay close attention to their feedback, as it dictates the product's core identity.
*   **Timeline is Critical:** The current date is **late February 2026**. You have just completed Phase 1 of a 5-week sprint. Phase 2 (Clans & Leaderboards) is next.
*   **Start with the FAQ:** Your first task is to implement the FAQ tweak requested by the user before moving on to Phase 2.
