# FREE11 - Sports Fan Community Platform

## Positioning (Non-Negotiable)
**FREE11 is a sports fan community / social entertainment product, NOT a gaming app.**
- App store category: Community + Participation + Consumption
- Language: Avoid win / bet / odds / prize money
- UX: Dream11-familiar for reduced learning curve

## Original Problem Statement
Build a cricket prediction and engagement platform for capturing 60 million displaced RMG users in India. Designed as a "Demand Rail Engine" where users convert skill (cricket predictions) into coins, redeemable for brand-funded real goods.

## Delivery Model (LOCKED)
- **Phase 1 = Beta** — ONE consolidated drop (COMPLETE)
- **Phase 2 = Final MVP** — ONE consolidated drop (polish + stability)
- **MVP 1.5** — Rummy / Poker / Teen Patti (coins only) — May 1, 2026
- No piecemeal releases. No weekly drops.

---

## Core Product Thesis
- **Demand Rail Engine**: Cricket prediction is PRIMARY, mini-games are secondary boosters
- **Brand-Funded Model**: All rewards are brand-sponsored with tracked ROAS
- **PRORGA-Safe**: Coins are non-financial (non-purchasable, non-withdrawable, non-transferable)
- **Skill-First**: Rankings based on prediction ACCURACY, not coin balance

---

## Phase 3 Exit Criteria - ALL MET ✅

### A. Voucher Delivery = Auditable Clearing Rail ✅

- `delivery_provider_id` - Provider's reference ID
- `delivery_timestamp_utc` - Delivery timestamp
- `delivery_history[]` - Full attempt history

**Features:**
- Idempotency checks prevent duplicate vouchers
- Retry logic with MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
- Manual override flag for admin
- Admin endpoints: `/admin/audit/`, `/admin/retry/`, `/admin/manual-fulfill/`

### B. ROAS Dashboard Optics ✅

### E. Transactional Email Notifications ✅
- Email service with Resend provider abstraction
- Voucher delivered/failed/retry notifications
- Email logs stored with status + timestamp
- Transactional only (no marketing)

### F. Infra Hardening ✅
- Load test: 100+ concurrent requests pass

## Admin Beta Dashboard - FIXED (Feb 24, 2026)

### Issue Fixed
The Admin Beta Dashboard (`/admin`) was displaying all metrics as zero despite having real user data.

**Root Cause:** The frontend `api.js` utility was missing a generic `get()` method. The `Admin.js` component was calling `api.get('/admin/beta-metrics')` but this method didn't exist.

**Fix Applied:** Added generic `get()` and `post()` methods to `/app/frontend/src/utils/api.js`:
```javascript
get: (endpoint) => axios.get(`${API}${endpoint}`, { headers: getAuthHeader() }),
post: (endpoint, data) => axios.post(`${API}${endpoint}`, data, { headers: getAuthHeader() }),
```

### Current Beta Metrics (as of Feb 24, 2026)
- **Beta Users:** 5
- **Invites Used:** 4
- **Predictions:** 0
- **Redemptions:** 4 (40% adoption)
- **Coins in Circulation:** 15,400
- **Loop Completion:** 0% (no users completed Predict → Redeem)
- **Beta Health Status:** "Needs Work"

### Invite Codes Status
- **Generated:** 50 (Wave 1 - simple format: BETA01-BETA50)
- **Used:** 4
- **Available:** 46
